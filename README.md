## Who should come?
The goal of this workshop is to spread adoption of cloud native technologies, so we will
largely focus on lowering the barrier of entry for new users. That being said,
we want to keep it lively, so we will on occasion cover some of the cloud native tools and technologies in deep.


Folks who are already comfortable with cloud native technologies are strongly encouraged to attend and
help answer questions, provide tips for new users, and to help advocate for
expanding the adoption.
